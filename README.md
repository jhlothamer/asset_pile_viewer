# Asset Pile Viewer

The Asset Pile Viewer is a utility that allows you to preview your assets in one window.  Just select a folder where all your assets are located and you can begin playing sounds and viewing images.  You can also filter the file list with a search term or filter on keywords.  Keywords can be added to files, or to folders for search and organization.

Features include:

  * Previewing all assets under a selected folder
  * Adding keywords to folders and files
  * Filter assets by file name and keywords
  * Supports Windows and Linux.
